## v1.1
- Now uses the unofficial [GameMaker 8.2](https://gm82.cherry-treehouse.com) (mainly for the newer OS fixes, like the massive lag when a joystick is unplugged).
- Added song display option (F7)
- 2-8 is now a unique level (unused in the original version) instead of being a duplicate of 2-6
- Many fixes for widescreen
- Replaced Classic Mario Forever link with Mario Forever Community Edition
- Added a slightly-fixed version of NSMF2012 World Maker
- The project files are no longer bundled with compiled builds to decrease filesize. They can still be found on the GitHub repo: https://github.com/CST1229/NSMF2012SlightlyFixed
